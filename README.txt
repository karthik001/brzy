Hello,

The Brzy Framework is currently in a pre 0.2 release state.  There's still 
plenty of work to do including some major refactoring.  I doubt you can get
it to work.  Once I have a buildable version I'll declare it 0.2 and create
the download and install instructions.

Thanks for taking a look.
